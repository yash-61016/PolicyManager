## How program works
The company charges an excess (the amount the client will have to pay) of Â£30 for each claim.

Clients can choose to increase this up to Â£70.00 (in multiples of 10) 
to reduce the premium â€“ for each Â£10 increase the premium is reduced by 5%.

The default payment term is monthly. 
However, customers can choose to pay annually to receive an additional 10% discount.

As well as entering the inputs identified above, the user will also provide the following:
-Policy reference number (eg: JB123A â€“ two letters, three digits and a letter).
-Client name (eg: J Smith â€“ maximum of 20 characters)
